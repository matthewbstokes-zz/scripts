Autodelete
=================
Autodelete is exactly as it sounds- it's a way to keep a folder under control. E.g. With the ability to download/buy/rent/insert_word_here movies whenever you want why keep movies just sitting on your computer? Set autodelete to remove these files in a folder after a certain number of days.
